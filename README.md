1.	<!----------------------------------------------------------------About Me------------------------------------------------------------------->

You are now viewing the README for my very first milestone project. I must say that I am quite proud of what I have
been able to do since I began this course with Code Institute 3 weeks ago. I am a 33 year old Australian expat currently
residing in Sweden. I moved here to be with my partner and we live together in Gothenburg. I moved to Sweden when I
was 25years old, I came here without any education higher than a highschool diploma. Due to my lack of knowledge of
the language and any specialised skills I began working in the Hospitality industry serving first as a bartender,
then a bar manager while taking on extra work as a DJ. Back in Australia I had not paid much attention to my 
highschool studies and failed to achieve a competitive grade for university entrance. I began taking alternative 
pathway courses at great expense but eventually dropped out as I was offered a job as a radio host.
	My present career path I found rewarding in its own way. However I felt it was time to gain a specialist
skill that can provide greater compansation for my time and give me a better work/life balance. I am not willing
to start a family as a shift worker. I began searching for education options in Sweden but again found my low
university entrance scores to be a hindrance. I would have had to first take swedish language classes full time 
to reach an academic level of language then take the Swedish version of University prep studies followed by a 
diploma in a certain field before I was eligible to compete for a place in University. In total that would have 
taken me 6 years to complete, which I cannot afford to do. 
	I found Code Institute then began researching the software development occupation and became intrigued.
I had assumed that pursuing a career in this field required a high level of mathematics which is one of my
weakest areas of study. I have always entertained the idea in the back of my mind, for years thinking of 
potential smartphone apps and game ideas etc. But now with Code Institute I feel I could at least enter the 
tech world with a skill in web development that can get me to rewarding positions while also providing me 
the ability to explore entrepreneurial opportunities. I do like the idea of bieng able to write software apps 
that can generate at the very least an extra €100 every month on the app store without me having to spend much 
time with it every day. But who knows where the future is, at least with the skills that I am learning with 
Code Institute I feel confident that I will be there at the forefront when the future arrives.



2.	<!----------------------------------------------------------------About The Project PEMAB site----------------------------------------------->

As part of my first Milestone project I had thought that maybe it might be a good idea to build the project 
around the needs of a real world client rather than building something based on the example ideas provided
by the course material. It was then that my partners father had told me he was interested in a website to 
promote his business called PEMAB. Opportunity had come knocking and so I began planning. My client is a one man B2B
consultation company. He works with businesses to action cost efficiency plans, project management and
implementation and some other things that I have not much understanding of at this point. His primary mode
of attracting clients is through word of mouth. Which suits him so far as each project he takes on can last for
many years.
	He is based in Sweden and works mainly with Swedish clients. However he has spent many years working
for another firm in the USA providing similar services and would like to be able to advertise his services to
a global audience.

	His needs as outlined are:

	1. A simple static website that will allow him to explain what he does for prospective clients
	2. A professional layout that matches his company branding to provide online credibility
	3. Provide prospective clients a way to contact him at all times without having to set telephone
	   appointments first
	4. Allow for a language option for Swedish language only content so that he wont risk alienating
	   his local audience
	5. Provide a platform for media content should he create it in the future

This is the first time I have attempted to build a website and I am quite happy with the results. Using only 
the material provided by the course and some handy google search skills that I have picked up along the way
I feel that this is a great personal achievement. I have not used any pre-made templates, had no significant
help with writing my code. Used no resources to plagiarise the work of others and only implemented ideas that
were I came up with. As you can see this is not the most ground-breaking of designs but I did what I could
with the knowledge that I have so far. 
	For me to be able to acheive this I followed the examples provided by the Whiskey Drop bootstrap 
lessons and the UCD Resume project lessons as a guide to where I should get started and how to implement the
technologies into my own design. I also used other sources such as w3schools, stackoverflow and Bootstrap4 
documentation for detailed explanations of certain code sequences I was trying to use to make my design 
flow the way it should. I had to use code snippets from sources such as bootstrap documentation and other
places to make things like my navbar and modal work in my design. More on those in the credits. I also 
used ideas from my Mentor Brian Macharia who gave me inspiration on how to plan and to even begin implementing my designs
into code. Finally I relied heavily upon the support channels provided by Code Institute mainly, the tutoring 
tab and advice from my teacher Xavier A. who provided me with guidance on how to solve the issues that I came
across during development. 

	Some things that you must know while reviewing this project:

	1. At the time of submission I was not able to get any meaningful content from my client to fill out 
	   the site. As is right now it will have to be submitted as a template that I will continue working on
	   in the future when my client is ready to complete the site. This project should be considered an
	   MVP
	2. My modal contact form is currently non functioning. There has been nothing in my lessons so far that
	   covers how to make it live. This is a feature that I will continue to develop with my client as I 
	   learn more on JavaScript. Also the modal and contact form I used came from a code snippet which 
	   I altered to suit the needs of the project. I would like to implement a different message in the
	   pop up that comes up in the entry fields when the wrong data has been put in for the Swedish
           language version. However the explanantions on how to do this revolved around using JQuery 
	   and JavaScript which at this point I have no education in.
	3. My Navbar is a heavily altered code snippet found in the Bootstrap documentation website and
	   therefore do not claim it as original code written by me. I hope this is not counted as plagiarism
	   although the lessons up to this point that did involve navbars have been using the same code snippets
	   from the same source. 
	4. Adding in the iframe functionality to display an introductory video came after the design process was
	   completed and development began. So therefore this is not represented in the wireframes that were created
	   to guide the development of this product.
	5. Placement of nav items and links changed during development process as it became more clearer what worked
	   better for the overall UX design. Some elements were removed in the design such as social media links
	   as the client wished to not have this on his site. These changes are not reflected in the original 
	   wireframe designs.
	6. Additional pages for content relating to Mission Statement and Our Team were opted out by the client
	   and deemed unnessesary 
	7. Further changes from original design include how contents blocks are placed in tablet size screens,
	   and the removal of a dedicated contact form on the Contact us pages as there was already a contact
           modal available on every page of the site. This was replaced by a basic display of contact information
	8. Navbar in tablet screens was originally planned to be resized into a hamburger icon however it was
	   opted to remain with a full navbar during development.



3.	<!----------------------------------------------------------------UX-------------------------------------------------------------------------> 

The UX process I found was one that I was constantly going back and forwards on. I had made designs, then as development 
progressed these designs got altered in slight ways such as content positioning and the removal/adding of features as time 
went on. Here is a list of user stories created to inform the design process:

	* As the site owner I would like to create a web presence to passively generate new clients
	* As the site owner I would like to broadcast my message to a global audience without
	  alienating my local one
	* As the site owner a professional appearance is important to me so that I may appear to be 
	  a reliable thought leader in my field.
	* As a user I do not have time to waste on unhelpful information. I need to see what is on offer
	  as quickly as possible
	* As a user un-professional looking documents negatively impacts my decision to engage in lengthy
	  and costly B2B transactions
	* As a user I do not have time to wait to make phonecalls at unreasonable hours due to timezone differences
	  I would like to be able to contact the site owner at anytime.

UX design as seen through the 5 planes created by Jesse James Garrett

	3.1 Strategy 

Site Owner: B2B Consultant
Targeted site users: Business Managers

This project is for a B2B consultant to provide online credibility and to allow for a passive way of growing his client 
base.The client works closely with other businesses on a day to day basis helping them create efficient and profitable 
solutions to thier operations. The functions are varied and require working on site to provide his services to his clients. 
The needs of the site owner do not require a complex web application as his work is in the field. His reqiurements for the 
site are as follows.

 1. Provide an online presence that allows business managers seeking consultation to show his existence and what kind of 
    services he can provide
 2. Provide advertising that will appeal to business managers assuring them of his authority in this particular field
 3. Allow for a global audience to view and engage with his services as he is primarily based in a country where English 
    is not the primary language
 3. Facilitate contact between prospective clients and his business

The targeted audience are Business Managers who are looking for expert consultants to engage with in order to solve any 
issues they may be having in thier operations. Unfortunately I have no experience in enaging with B2B enterprises or know 
of anybody that does so I was not able to conduct research into their needs in this timeframe. However I have made the 
following criterea based on what I beleive will be relevant to potential clients of a B2B consultant.

 1. The user will be browsing content during company time therefore efficiency of information delivery is important to 
    remain engaging
 2. The user will be most interested in viewing services provided as a primary goal to deciding on engaging with a consultant
 3. Stories about the consultants mission statements and company values etc will be considered as seconday or almost
    irrelevant information to deciding on engagement with the client
 4. The user will be used to browsing professionally created web documents with intuitive functionality therefore
    any design that does not flow corrrectly from top to bottom, left to right will be a cause for negative
    interaction
 5. Plain text documents will be part of the users day to day role so to remain engaging the site must have 
    appropriate use of colors and imagery to provide identity to the site they are browsing
 5. The order of presentation of information should begin with the solutions for the Business Managers needs first
    then proceed to more detailed descriptions of the services the consultant can provide to solve those needs. Followed
    by a sales pitch as to why the user should engage with the site owner for their services. More personal information
    about the site owner such as history, past projects etc should be presented as optional content to view after the
    other content is displayed
 6. Calls to action need to be displayed on every page to minimize browsing time and loading multiple pages.

Summary Points:
* Simple and inviting layout that directs the flow of information in an efficient and engaging manner
* Create an identity for the web document based on site owners branding
* Minimal filler content as to not waste time
* Priority of solutions to user needs first as this adds value followed by supporting material to engage the user
* Call to action for the user on every page

	3.2 Scope

Based on the information in the Strategy plane here are the list of design goals organised into the following categories;

* Will Do - Goals that will be implemented into the project

* Stretch Goals - Features that can be implemented or refined given time

* Wont Do - Features that were discussed but deemed unnessecary or not feasable by deadline
	

	Will Do
	* Professional document layout
	* Color scheming to create a document identity
	* Responsive Design
	* Language selector for local and global clients
	* Call to action for clients to contact site user


	Stretch Goals
	* Adding in meaningful content to provide the site with context for this project - Slow response from my client 
	  in regards to content
	* Refining color scheme to suit the site owners tastes
	

	Wont Do
	* Making the contact form functional - Do not know enough about Jquery before deadline
	* Pages for Our Team and Mission Statement - Unnecessary for the site goals and considered filler content
	* Google Maps in Contact Us - The site owner has no dedicated place of business so displaying a map 
	  is not necessary

Summary:

Primary Needs
* Functional well designed document
* Easy to understand features
* Minimal filler content

	3.3 Structure

The pages were designed to be efficient at delivering key information from top to bottom, left to right. This is to allow
for simple and clear communication with minimal confusion or filler. 

Every page has the following structure:

Navbar - At the top and remains there as the user scrolls down the screen. From left to right the links are delivered in 
order of priority. To the far left the company logo will always return you to the index page. Then the links begin with 
services provided the primary information asset for this site. Followed by About us which will provide supporting 
information and Contact Us. To the far right is a drop down menu that allows you to select your preferred viewing 
language. English or Swedish. If you select an option from this drop down it will reload the page you are viewing
with the language selected. No need to navigate the site again

Title Banner - Makes it clear what section of information you are viewing

Content Blocks - The top most being the highest priority information flowing downwards to the lower tiers of priority.
If there is more than one content block per page the content is viually separated by alternating background colors between 
white and grey. This also allows the eyes to consume each block throuroughly without skipping into other content blocks
Content order of priority:
 1. Solutions to problems the user may have
 2. Reasons why the user should engage with the site owner
 3. Additional relevant information the user may find informative

Call to Action - At the bottom of each page to invite the user to contact the site owner

Footer - Currently used as a space to place the site owners logo and to bookend the content, No social media links or 
other information is desired to be displayed here by the site owner. The footer is colored in a dark grey while the rest of 
the site uses light shades of yellow and blue. This is a visual indication that there is no more content to view 
on the page

Summary:
* Page reads top to bottom in order of priority
* Navigation is read left to right in order of priority 
* Content is divided by visual cues to ensure clear and structured communication

	3.4 Skeleton
The Information is presented in short easily digestable blocks with high priority information first followed by secondary.
The information is also divided by visual cues to ensure the information in each block is read and understood.
Information flows down and across the page in order of priority. 

	3.5 Surface
The finished product should successfully achieve the goals of this projecty by producing a professional and 
eye catching product that is easy to understand, easy to use and fulfils the requirements of the owner
and the user.

Color scheming will reflect the colors of the business brand which was by extention originally 
inspired by the national colors of Sweden. Font differentiation between Headlines and important
elements to body text to add more definition to each content area.

To minimise filler content I have removed the 'home' or 'start' link, The user may click on the business logo
in the nav and in the footer to return to the index pages. 


4. 	<!----------------------------------------------------------------Features-------------------------------------------------------------------> 

**Responsive Navbar: <nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-expand-sm fixed-top nav-bg-color">

Taken from the bootstrap documentation site edited with my own css for color, background color, font family and positioning. 
Navbar will remain fixed to the top of the viewing screen. Navbar has image nested within for branding purposes

**Collapsable Nav icon for smaller viewports: 

<button class="navbar-toggler ml-auto" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNavDropdown"
         aria-controls="navbarNavDropdown" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button>

A bootstrap button with styling alterations. Collapes the navbar into an icon when viewed on small screens to make navigation and content 
presentation easier and cleaner.

**Language Selector:
<div class="dropdown"><button class="btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="dropdownMenu1" data-toggle="dropdown"
aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"></button>

Bootstrap dropdown menu nested in the navbar altered for styling and function purposes. The drop down presents a link which will load
the page on your chosen language preference. Language selector will collapse into the hamburger icon for smaller screens

**Bootstrap Grid:
<div class=container><div class=row><div class=col>

Used to position my content around the page, allowed for responsiveness. For the user this means they will get a great 
viewing experience no matter the device they are view the site on

**Modal
<div class="modal fade left" id="myModal"><div class="modal-dialog">

Credits for code snippet found in credits section. Provides a pop up that when activated allows the user to contact the site owner.

**iframe
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1M2y3UgNWw"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="player-padding">
</iframe>

Video credit in can be found in the credits section. Allows the site owner to display video content on their site. The user 
will be able to view it providing a dynamic web experience. Also allows for a more engaging delivery method for information.



5. 	<!----------------------------------------------------------------Technologies Used---------------------------------------------------------->

HTML:
Html was the first language introduced to us. It provides the skeleton the website is built upon. But in my case a better analogy would be
that the HTML provided blocks for the other frameworks to occupy on the page

CSS:
Second language introduced to us. I used it to provide stylings to my HTML document. I also used it to target and overide bootstrap classes
to suit my own needs.

Bootstrap:
The first framework introduced to us. I used it extensively to provide responsiveness and for content positioning. I also used many of the 
features from the bootstrap website such as buttons, navbar, dropdown togglers etc. Bootstrap has mainly shaped the content you see on my site 


6.	<!----------------------------------------------------------------Testing-------------------------------------------------------------------->

W3c Validtor:

Used this resource to see if my project validates.

Chrome Dev Tools:

Used this to test for responsiveness and effectiveness of rendering for different device sizes.

Manual Testing through Gitpod Preview:

Tested to see that all links were working and performed the functions that were desired.

Github Pages:

Hosted the site live to see if there were any differences between my workspace and how the site looked live. Turns out there was some
pathway issues in regards to some of my images which allowed them to load and display in preview mode but were not found on the 
hosted site. fixed issues by prefixing image pathways with ./

For now Contact Form is non functional however modal was tested and functions as expected. In the future I would like to be able to change the
message in the form that pops up when the user enters invalid data.

User Story testing:
	
	* As the site owner I would like to create a web presence to passively generate new clients
	** Done, site created and hosted live with functionality to allow users to contact you 24 hours a day with minimal maintenance 

	* As the site owner I would like to broadcast my message to a global audience without
	  alienating my local one
	** Done, site has option to switch content displayed in either English or local language

	
	* As the site owner a professional appearance is important to me so that I may appear to be 
	  a reliable thought leader in my field.
	** Done, Site effectively uses color and visual cues to deliver a clean and flowing document that also allows for
	   video content to be displayed

	* As a user I do not have time to waste on unhelpful information. I need to see what is on offer
	  as quickly as possible
	** Done, information displayed is set in priority based on your needs first

	* As a user un-professional looking documents negatively impacts my decision to engage in lengthy
	  and costly B2B transactions
	** Done, documents have a clean and easy to follow structure and allows for clear and precise communication

	* As a user I do not have time to wait to make phonecalls at unreasonable hours due to timezone differences
	  I would like to be able to contact the site owner at anytime.
	** Done, site has functionality to allow you to make contact wth the site owner at anytime.


7.	<!----------------------------------------------------------------Deployment----------------------------------------------------------------->

Site is deployed on GitHub pages here 
https://christopher-simpson.github.io/Milestone-1/

At the time of project submission there is no meaningful content that would be of use to my client. I have now forked the
project so that I may continue working on the site in the future for my client when we both have time to return to the project.

The fork for further development is here 
https://christopher-simpson.github.io/pemab-template/

At this point in time there is no difference between these two versions
